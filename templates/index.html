        <p class = 'otherSectionsST'>I am Zachary Koeppl, A Web Developer with a strong interest in learning and honing my skills. Every website I create teaches me something new and I love trying out new technologies.
            With Web Development I also love automating repetetive tasks using python. I have made a few scripts that automate things such as: commenting on youtube shorts, spam uploading videos,
            and data collectors that scavenge Best Buy to try to find in stock GPUs.

        <h3 id = 'projectstitle' class = 'otherSections'>My Story</h3>
        <p class = 'otherSectionsST'>Ever since I was a kids I have always loved computers and wanted to do things involving them. I loved building them and tinkering with them. At the age of 12 I built my first computer
            made out of scrap parts that my dad garbage picked. This computer was my pride and joy! Until I knocked it off the table and the hard drive, which was not secured, fell and corrupted all
            of the data on it... R.I.P First Aid merit badge book. Once I got my first job at 16 I saved up money to build my first computer. It had a GTX 1070 graphics card with an i5-6600k CPU and was
            my first real step into the world of computers. With this computer I could do lots of things that my other machines were too slow to do and then began my journey into programming. It first
            started out using simple Auto Hotkey scripts to click on cookie clicker and then ended up with me making many programs and websites that would use technologies a lot more powerful and versatile
            than Auto Hotkey was. We are here today and I am glad to say that my journey has barely started. I have a lot more to learn and I am excited for what the future has in store for me.
